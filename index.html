            <h3>3. Customer Segmentation </h3>
            <p>I undertook a comprehensive process of customer segmentation by analyzing annual income and spending patterns. After determining the optimum number of clusters, I applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to effectively group customers based on their spending habits. The visualization of these clusters on a scatter plot provided a tangible and insightful way to understand the distinct categories of customers in relation to their financial behaviors.
